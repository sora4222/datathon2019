# Datathon Melbourne 2019
This is using the data released

Current to do list:
The images are separated by band (pretty much channel but over a much 
larger number of frequencies). 
 * Fuse the common color bands together, and then produce an image for each day
 * Have the image for each day masked with the bands that are coming through
 * Use these images to create an animation which can be used with the team to
 produce visual insights
 
## Clouds
Clouds are a major problem for the images that we have been given. The effect
of the clouds on the individual bands will be important for visual analysis.
